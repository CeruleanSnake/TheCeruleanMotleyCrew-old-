                Your name is CHEVER STALII.<br>
                You are the head security officer of the Outer Orbit Alternia Prison.<br>
                Possibly one of the harshest prisons in Empire space.<br><br>
                You used to dream of becoming a grand pirate, losing yourself in dreams of wild adventures.
                Somewhere along the way, life had other plans.<br>
                With your expertise in technological security and bio
                mechanics, you were hand-picked when the prison was first launched.<br><br>You worked hard to rise in
                ranks, and now you are practically in charge of the whole prison's security... at least as in charge as
                you can be
                under the iron rule of The Director anyway.<br><br>
                And yet, you are utterly miserable.<br><br>You catch yourself drifting into your memories as you gaze
                upon the medallion you kept for all those sweeps. For some reason, you could never let it leave your
                side.
