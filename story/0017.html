                    Your name is CHEVER STALII.<br>
                    You are the head security officer of the Outer Orbit Alternia Prison.<br>
                    Possibly one of the harshest prisons in Empire space.
                    <br><br>
                    You used to dream of becoming a grand pirate, losing yourself in dreams of wild adventures.
                    Somewhere along the way, life had other plans.<br>
                    With your expertise in technological security and bio
                    mechanics, you were hand-picked when the prison was first launched.
                    <br><br>
                    You worked hard to rise in ranks, and now you are practically in charge of the whole prison's
                    security... at least as in charge as you can be
                    under the iron rule of The Director anyway.
                    <br><br>
                    And yet, you are utterly miserable.
                    <br><br>
                    You catch yourself drifting into your memories as you
                    gaze upon the medallion you kept for all those sweeps. For some reason, you could never let it leave
                    your side.

                            A fun bit of trivia, Chever is the oldest (in terms of creation) character in this comic.
                            <br><br>
                            I created them in 2011 and they have undergone so much transformation since then. Probably
                            the one core feature that never changed throughout the years was their antennas, my idea of
                            a troll's version of hearing aids.
                            <br><br>
                            The name Chever was also a bastardized version of Chester, don't remember where I got Stalii
                            from but no it wasn't from Stalin lol.
