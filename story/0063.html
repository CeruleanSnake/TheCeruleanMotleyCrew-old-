                You are completely unprepared for the gruesome sights before you.<br><br>
                The constant fluorescent hum is only broken by the quick draw of your own gasp. Damn bastard
                had a lab in here!<br><br>
                Well, at least this explains why a lot of prisoners were mysteriously "discharged" or "expired from
                unknown causes."<br>
                You had your suspicions, but you never thought the prison would be a front to freely gather test
                subjects!<br><br> No wonder the rebellion has been extremely violent ever since that prisoner
                escaped.<br><br>
                You wonder why Diunna never said anything.

                        This is so far the only panel with actual fucking nudity in it, tastefully censored of
                        course.<br><br>
                        I probably should have thrown in more nefarious scientist clutter... maybe a bloodied labcoat, a
                        strap bench, maybe some decaying limbs or something. Really sell it that it's a super secret
                        evil
                        lab.<br><br>
