                    You are completely unprepared for the gruesome sights before you.
                    <br><br>
                    The constant fluorescent hum is only broken by the quick draw of your own gasp. Damn bastard
                    had a lab in here!
                    <br><br>
                    Well, at least this explains why a lot of prisoners were mysteriously "discharged" or "expired from
                    unknown causes."<br>
                    You had your suspicions, but you never thought the prison would be a front to freely gather test
                    subjects!
                    <br><br>
                    No wonder the rebellion has been extremely violent ever since that prisoner
                    escaped.
                    <br><br>
                    You wonder why Diunna never said anything.

                            This is so far the only panel with actual fucking nudity in it, tastefully censored of
                            course.

                            I probably should have thrown in more nefarious scientist clutter... maybe a bloodied
                            labcoat, a
                            strap bench, maybe some decaying limbs or something. Really sell it that it's a super secret
                            evil
                            lab.

                            Also, Diunna sure did a piss poor job at cleaning the place.
