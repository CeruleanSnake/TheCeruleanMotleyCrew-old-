                    You were so engrossed in the report, you failed to see the mess you are now pretty much walking in
                    to.

                    Damn psiionics!<br>

                    Oh and she was one of your best security officers. Maybe you should have let her transfer to to D

                    <br><br>
                    Oh well... Might as well tell off this damn rebel. <br>
                    If they think they can just psiionically murder your staff, they
                    have another thing coming!
