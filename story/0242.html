                                I Had almost finished preparations to set sail as the crew load the last of the cargo
                                on. Edmond decided to contact me though our private telecommunications, the only bloody
                                technological thing that works on this planet. <br>
                                He tells me he is sending over his
                                trusty
                                boy in search of 3 fugitives. I'm to lend my ship to his aid should he need it.

                                <br><br>Of course he reminds me it's his damn ship from his old moirail, but I'm the
                                damn captain! That lad of his though will be a good temporary help. last I saw him, he
                                was a wee lad but if Eddie's experiment went well he should be a strong lackey. <br>
                                Either
                                way, I set to leave Yukkoda tommorow.<br><br><br><br>

                                So who should show up yesterday as I was enjoying my pint but a motley crew of 3 all
                                matching the descriptions Eddie gave me. Quite literally walked through my door without
                                having to lift a finger. The little one sure can hold his... her? Bah, they sure can
                                hold their liquor.<br>
                                Though, with this medallion I got off them, I got a suspicion they're a lot more
                                connected to old Eddie than he lets on.
                                <br><br>

                                Now Eddie said he want's them alive, but I think these three can get a better price on
                                the market. Sorry Edmond, but you owe me a bit for th
