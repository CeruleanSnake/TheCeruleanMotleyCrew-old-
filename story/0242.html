                    Quickly, you tuck the medallion around your neck and behind your shirt.<br>You're never letting this

                    You then pick up the book. It looks to be Finscar's log.<br><br>
                    Wow... He writes nowhere near how he talks.

                                    23rd of the blooming Season's 2nd trimester, YD 1698<br><br>

                                    I Had almost finished preparations to set sail as the crew load the last of the
                                    cargo
                                    on. Edmond decided to contact me though our private telecommunications, the only
                                    bloody
                                    technological thing that works on this planet. <br>
                                    He tells me he is sending over his
                                    trusty
                                    boy in search of 3 fugitives. I'm to lend my ship to his aid should he need it.

                                    <br><br>Of course he reminds me it's his damn ship from his old moirail, but I'm the
                                    damn captain! That lad of his though will be a good temporary help. last I saw him,
                                    he
                                    was a wee lad but if Eddie's experiment went well he should be a strong lackey. <br>
                                    Either
                                    way, I set to leave Yukkoda tommorow.<br><br><br><br>

                                    24th of the blooming Season's 2nd trimester, YD 1698<br><br>

                                    So who should show up yesterday as I was enjoying my pint but a motley crew of 3 all
                                    matching the descriptions Eddie gave me. Quite literally walked through my door
                                    without
                                    having to lift a finger. The little one sure can hold his... her? Bah, they sure can
                                    hold their liquor.<br>
                                    Though, with this medallion I got off them, I got a suspicion they're a lot more
                                    connected to old Eddie than he lets on.
                                    <br><br>

                                    Now Eddie said he want's them alive, but I think these three can get a better price
                                    on
                                    the market. Sorry Edmond, but you owe me a bit for th
