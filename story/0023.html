                You watch him scurry off in a rather flustered manner.<br>
                Poor guy was red as a tomato, but at least you took his mind off your medallion. <br><br>Plus, it was
                kinda
                fun.<br><br>
                You do miss your rendezvous with him. But something happened after you were both caught together. Such a
                scandle was gossiped among your co-workers for ages. You
                never copped anything but you don't know about Derrek. Either way, he's been giving you a shoulder
                colder
                than the southern poles after that.<br><br>
                No point dwelling on the past. You have a prisoner to process. There's been an awful influx of psiionic
                trolls ever since The Summoner's rebellion reached its peak.<br><br>
                Normally most of the lowbloods would be culled on the spot but The Director <i>insisted</i> they can be
                reformed.<br><br>
                You have always had a strong feeling its a farce but you haven't been able to prove
                it.<br><br><i>Yet.</i>
