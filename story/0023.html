                    You watch him scurry off in a rather flustered manner.<br>
                    Poor guy was red as a tomato, but at least you took his mind off your medallion.
                    <br><br>
                    Plus, it was kinda fun.
                    <br><br>
                    You do miss your rendezvous with him. But something happened after you were both caught together.
                    Such a scandal was gossiped among your co-workers for ages. You
                    never copped anything but you don't know about Derrek. Either way, he's been giving you a shoulder
                    colder than the southern poles after that.
                    <br><br>
                    No point dwelling on the past. You have a prisoner to process. There's been an awful influx of
                    psiionic trolls ever since The Summoner's rebellion reached its peak.
                    <br><br>
                    Normally most of the lowbloods would be culled on the spot but The Director <i>insisted</i> they can
                    be reformed.
                    <br><br>
                    You have always had a strong feeling its a farce but you haven't been able to prove it.
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Yet.</i>
