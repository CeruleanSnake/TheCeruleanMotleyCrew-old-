                All is quiet in the halls as you solemnly polish floors during the off hours.
                There may be no sun on this prison station, but staff and inmates still need to sleep.<br><br>

                Your name is DIUNNA TYROON, but most people call you RAT. Mostly due to the sounds of your cleaning
                machines and your work hours.<br><br>
                At only 16 sweeps, you are Lead Janitor on this godforsaken hunk of metal. You are also the station's
                go-to Information
                Broker.<br><br>
                Thanks to your position, you are allowed access where even most security personnel can't go. This makes
                you the best in sourcing all sorts of info.<br>After all, who would suspect a lowly janitor?<br><br>
                You hope to one day leave this dump, but you have never had the opportunity.<br><br> For now you just
                zone out as you polish the same spot on the floor.

                        The machine there had a completely different shape, until I realised it looked a bit too much
                        like a certain anatomical part OOPS!<br><br>
                        Diunna's name is once again, another bastardized name, but from Dianna this time (very
                        original).<br>
                        Also I drew Diunna's horns way too short, they're supposed to be longer.<br>
