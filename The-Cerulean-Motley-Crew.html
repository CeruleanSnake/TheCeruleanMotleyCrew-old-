                            Welcome to The Cerulean Motley Crew!
                            <br><br>
                            This will have to be my biggest project I have ever taken up on. Would you also believe
                            this
                            was my
                            first ever time with major coding too? It's been a great experiment and project and I
                            have
                            learnt so
                            many skills, even despite my reboot from the <a
                                href="../archive/OriginalTCMC/The-Cerulean-Motley-Crew.html">Original
                                version</a>.<br>
                            I honestly don't regret rebooting, I have a much better story structure, more fleshed
                            out
                            characters
                            and the original served as a good training ground to get my style down. <br>
                            This project has also given me something creative to work on. Being physically disabled
                            it
                            can be
                            tough to actually get out and keep your mind active, so I guess you could say its kinda
                            like
                            my
                            therapy, lol!<br><br>

                            The original story was a concept I actually thought up many many years ago, probably
                            2012 or
                            so. I
                            never really did anything with it though. The first time I really started a MSPA-styled
                            was
                            with 3
                            other friends on <a href="https://mspfa.com/?s=6779&p=1">Go Stuck Yourself</a> in 2014
                            (I
                            drew the
                            Chaz Parts).<br>
                            Like many team projects, interest died and it fell to the wayside. I never really did
                            try
                            again
                            after that.<br><br>
                            So how did I get started on this?<br>
                            Years later, In 2020, I managed to catch up with a few old friends in the Homestuck
                            scene.
                            So I was
                            chatting away with <a href="https://mspfa.com/user/?u=111108168127693948558">peepee
                                swine</a> and
                            she was talking about how she throws in a bunch of trolls in the background of <a
                                href="https://mspfa.com/?s=21746&p=1">I'm Good, I'm Gone.</a> I said "Damn I wish my
                            troll was
                            in a fanventure or some sort" and she said "Why not make one?" So I said "You know what,
                            yeah! why
                            not?"<br>
                            So I sat down, dusted off my old pirate concept, polished it a bit and got to work.
                            Within
                            20 or so
                            days I had drawn up 30 panels and finally started publishing on MSPFA. Of course I got
                            sick,
                            saw
                            lots of doctors and it fell to the backburner a bit. <br><br>

                            It gave me some time to look over the story, realise what I wanted and where I was
                            struggling and
                            decided to reboot the comic a year later, so here we are today! Never been more prouder
                            in
                            any of my
                            projects!<br><br>

                            This commentary snippet has gone on way too long now, I promise the others wont be so
                            long
                            lol...
                            maybe...<br>
                            Anyway, enjoy reading! I've enjoyed drawing it!<br><br>
